Competitive Analysis – C3 Energy and Uptake and GE are three companies focusing on industrial internet and potential applications. However, Only GE offers a platform to develop applications which can be deployed on machines and perform analytics on data.  Operational Technology (OT) describes a piece of software or hardware that directly interacts with the physical world. The Industrial Internet is weaving together OT systems with IT (Information Technology) systems, via a concept called OT / IT convergence, now enabling end-to-end automation of complex processes such as asset optimization, monitoring, repair and maintenance. In an effort to create consistency within Industrial Internet systems, the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) drafted the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture. The Predix platform is an implementation of the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture.
